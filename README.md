# Pwned Password Checker

This Python script checks if your passwords have been exposed in data breaches using the [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API. By leveraging the k-anonymity model, the script only sends the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hashed password to the API, maintaining your password's security.

## Features

- **Secure Password Check**: Uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm to ensure password privacy.
- **Simple and Fast**: Quickly checks multiple passwords in one command.
- **Safety Warning**: Alerts you if your password has been compromised.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install requests

How It Works

	1.	The password is hashed using SHA-1.
	2.	The first 5 characters of the hashed password are sent to the Have I Been Pwned API.
	3.	The API returns a list of potential matches, and the script checks if the full hash is in the returned results.
	4.	If a match is found, the password is considered compromised.

Usage

Run the script from the command line by passing one or more passwords as arguments:

python pwned_password_checker.py <password1> <password2> ...

Example:

python pwned_password_checker.py password123 mySecureP@ssword

Output:

password123 was found 209384 times... you should probably change your password!
mySecureP@ssword was NOT found. Carry on!

Code Overview

	•	request_api_data(query_char): Sends the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hashed password to the API.
	•	get_password_leaks_count(hashes, hash_to_check): Searches the API response to check if the hash exists.
	•	pwned_api_check(password): Main function that takes a password, hashes it, and checks its exposure status.
	•	main(args): Iterates over provided passwords, displaying a message for each one about its safety.

Important Note

This script should not be used for storing or managing passwords. It is intended solely to check if a password is compromised by comparing it to breached data from Have I Been Pwned.

Disclaimer

Using this script with sensitive passwords is at your own risk. Although the script uses the k-anonymity model to protect your password, always exercise caution with password management.
